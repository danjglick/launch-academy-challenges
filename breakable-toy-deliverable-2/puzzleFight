- I have wireframes (with app description), er diagrams, and user stories
  - in a google drive folder at
    - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4GCUW7rz66LV2t5aC1aYmNFMTA
- I have a working react-rails app 
  - user can
    - view a responsive 6x6 grid
    - click a button to randomize grid positions for player, an enemy, and a reward
    - use arrow keys to move player around the grid
    - view the number of moves made
    - run into an enemy to empty the grid and zero the score
  - there is also a mostly-working database
- I have planned out the react file structure. 
  - This is probably where I have the most questions/doubts
